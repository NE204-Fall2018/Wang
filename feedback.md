# Overall
 - **This work is not sufficiently original**
 - Be careful! all of the commits in your history are shown as authored by 
   Dajie - this will need to be rectified for labs going forward!
 - Your commit history has very few commits - we talked about this a bit 
   after class but it is much better to have smaller, logically-consistent
   commits that make following the project history and navigation much easier
 - There is a lot of confusion of terminology in this report - I strongly 
   recommend you revisit Knoll

# Build (3/10)
 - You forgot to modify the README with your build instructions!
 - The listed link to the data is broken, `make data` fails
 - Similarly, analysis failed given your naming scheme for the data. Both these
   issues are addressed in commit 33813e7
 - In general, you don't want your analysis build to rely on user input; for
   example, your analysis pops up a plot when run from the command line. 
   Typically, the analysis should be entirely automated. If you want to have
   a separate command that visualizes plots before they are saved, consider
   implementing it as a separate command, e.g. `make show`

# Testing (10/10)
 - Consider practicing implementing tests for future projects!

# Intro / Background / Motivation (7/15)
 - Not quite adequate level of detail for the introduction - want more focus
   on the what and the why.
 - The statment describing energy calibration is incorrect.

# Methods (10/15)
 - Poor clarity and some technical inaccuracies

# Results and discussion

**NOT INDEPENDENTLY EVALUATED - SEE ABOVE**
