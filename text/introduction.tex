Energy calibration is the very first and important step before using HPGe detectors for radiation detection. A very common way to calibrate is using standard gamma-emitting source, for instance Co-60 and Cs-137. The goal of this experiment is to become familar with the p-type HPGe with co-axial configuration used and to learn how to appropriately fitting the date of signal intensity in each energy channel.
