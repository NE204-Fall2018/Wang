Energy calibration is the very first and important step before using HPGe detectors for radiation detection. A very common way to calibrate is using standard gamma-emitting source, for instance Co-60 and Cs-137. The p-type HPGe with co-axial configuration is used in this experiment and appropriately fitting the date of signal intensity in each energy channel is practiced.
