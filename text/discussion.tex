Using part of the five isotopes, one or two, still gives fairly close results. For example, using only Am-241 with a characteristic peak at 59.5409 keV and Cs-137 with a characteristic peak at 661.657 keV gives the following result, which is close to one using all five isotopes:
\[{Energy}=0.2805446 \cdot Channel\,Number+1.263557\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(2)\]
